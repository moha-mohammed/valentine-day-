To My Dearest Cupcake ❤️

My sweetest Bibicha,

From the very first moment you became mine, my heart has danced to a melody only you can play. Every word you whisper, every glance you steal, every laugh you share—each one is a note in the most beautiful love song ever composed.

You are my warmth on the coldest days, my light in the darkest nights, and my peace in the chaos of life. Loving you is not just something I do—it is who I am. You are the air I breathe, the dream I never want to wake up from, the adventure I never want to end.

My adorable Cupcake, you are the sweetest part of my life, soft and full of love, filling every moment with the taste of happiness. And my little Duck, no matter where life’s currents take us, I will always waddle beside you, never letting go.

You are the poetry in my silence, the stars in my sky, the home my heart belongs to. I will love you endlessly, faithfully, and unconditionally, forever and always.

With all my love,
Yours, now and forever. ❤️
